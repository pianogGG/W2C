# W2C
This is code for paper "Operator Optimization Based on Hardware Architecture Alignment Requirements: Higher Computation but Faster Speed"
You can use W2C scheme to accelate convolution/deconvolution that do not meet the hardware alignment requirements on Nvidia Tensor cores, Qualcomm DSPs, and Huawei NPUs.
